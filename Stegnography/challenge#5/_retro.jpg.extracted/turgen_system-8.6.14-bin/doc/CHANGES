=====================================

Major enhancements:

* Configurable sampling rates of 44100, 48000, 96000 and 22050 Hz
* Configuration of the signal outputs consolidated from 6 to 3 sections
* Pulse repository adjusted to accommodate various sampling rates
* The Standard, Turbo Blizzard, Turbo ROM and Turbo 6000 plugins provide
  increased accuracy of the signal with higher sampling rates
* Wave output and Audio output both allow initial and terminal silence

Bug fixes:

* Wizard for binary files could not create playlist items for the Turbo 6000
  plugin

Compatibility warning:

* After upgrade to this version, the product configuration is not fully
  preserved. Check the preferences and re-configure if needed.

Changes from version 8.6.12 to 8.6.13
=====================================

By releasing this version, I am repaing my debt to users from USA by
enhancing the Standard plugin. This is part of the previously started 
program stabilization efforts.

TSCBL - New loader for the Standard plugin

* The loader displays program title (up to 34 characters)
* Customizable background color 
* Customizable text luminance (allows for more reasonable
  foreground/background combinations for displaying the program title). 
* The loader can hide the cursor
* The loader can set silent I/O
* The loader allows cold start when you press SELECT+RESET
 
Other enhnancements of the Standard plugin

* Redesigned user interface
* You can enter hexadecimal ATASCII codes in the program title field.
  This way, the loader can display characters not accessible on?PC
	keyboard. See documentation for more details and syntax.
* You can decide not to convert the loader.
* Minimum duration of the leader tone is now 14 seconds, a safer value
 
Other changes and fixes

* The default signal amplitude was reduced to 75 % for both WAVE files
  and direct audio output. This value reduces the risk of clipping in
  the recording chain.
* Turbo 6000 was included in the Wizard for binary files
* Several sections of the documentation have been streamlined and
  updated.

Changes from version 8.6.11 to 8.6.12
=====================================
Enhancements:

* Pilot tone test dialog

Infrastructure

* Source code cleanup, inspection and transformation
* Minor documentation fixes

Changes from version 8.6.10 to 8.6.11
=====================================

The turgen.exe launcher has been upgraded, so it can use JRE or JDK to run the
product. This ensures compatibility with Java 9 and newer.
Updates in documentation reflecting changes in distribution of Java SE 9 and
newer.
To keep the download package small, Turgen System will not be shipped with its
own customized runtime environment.

All files needed for successful build from source code are now in GIT
No source code package, the source code is available in GIT
Support for trXX tape image chunks has been removed.
The trXX tape image chunks were used sparingly. If you need to use them, you
can download one of the older versions.

Other updates:
Minor UI updates. The batch processor dialog is more streamlined. The menu item
for displaying immediate pulse corrections has been moved to the View menu.
The tool for merging segments of binary files provides better input validation.
Fixes in documentation, misleading information in the Batch Processing section
has been corrected.

Changes from version 8.6.9 to 8.6.10
====================================
This is a minor bugfix release

Bugs fixed:

* B-TAPE plugin: Automatic file name creation fixed for file names without extension
* Turbo 2000 plugin: NullPointerException thrown during the BlockLoading conversion without a binary loader

Enhancements:

* Batch processing: Numbering of the output files is optional
* Wave output: It is now possible to number the output files
* Merging segments of binary file: Automatic determination of attributes of the code that replaces INIT segments

Changes from version 8.6.8 to 8.6.9
===================================
This is mainly a bugfix release with few enhancements.

Serious bugs fixed:

* Standard tape records: Eliminated unnecessary discontinuities in the signal caused by resetting phase after each block.
* Signal generators: Inverting polarity of pulses did not work for waveforms other than square. Now it works for all waveforms.
* Turbo Blizzard: Wrong widths of pulses frequently prevented loading files with real hardware. Pulse widths are fixed.
* Turbo Blizzard: Decoder updated with new pulse widths
* Omicron turbo: Tape boot file created with the "Faster boot" option was not bootable. Now it can be booted correctly.
* B-TAPE: Automatic file name creation was failing for file names with multiple periods. Fixed now.
* Rambit Turbo Tape: Default polarity of the pulses is now HIGH-LOW
* Rambit Turbo Tape: The "Invert polarity of the pulses" option was ignored. It is now honored.
* Turbo 6000: The default polarity of the pulses is now LOW-HIGH.
* Turbo 6000: The ChainLoader loader was fixed to expect natural polarity of the Turbo 6000 pulses.

Enhancements:

* Output to the sound card: The generated signal is always double-buffered. Configuration entry enabling this function was removed
* Standard tape records: More transfer speeds are available
* Turbo Blizzard: Now you can prepend MICROLOADER or SHORT KOS, either as a tape boot file or Turbo Blizzard file.
* KSO Turbo 2000: Decoder provides an option to decode files with a loader. The loader is expected to be 1 block long.

Architectural Changes:

* Some packages and plugins were renamed or moved from package to package
* The Turbo Blizzard plugin was refactored and streamlined

Acknowledgements

* Many thanks to ATARIONLINE.PL users for their help with Turbo Blizzard and KSO Turbo 2000
* Many thanks to PHAERON for help with Rambit Turbo Tape and Turbo 6000



Changes from version 8.6.7 to 8.6.8
===================================

Serious Bugs Fixed

* The Standard plugin doesn't automatically elongate IRGs after blocks that hold INIT segments to 1500 ms as it should.
* All plugins that generate data blocks of a regular size can insert silence or elongate IRG before block that actually holds an INIT segment. This happens when an INIT segments begin in one block and ends in a consequent block.

**Users of the Standard plugin are advised to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.**

Other Changes and Enhancements

* The Omicron Turbo provides a new conversion - Twokilobyte Blocks. This conversion is suitable for binary load files that consist of many small segments
* BlockLoading conversion is the default one for Turbo 2000 and Super Turbo
* All national flags are slightly smaller


Changes from version 8.6.6 to 8.6.7
===================================

This version brings cassette authoring enhancements

* Improved status bar that displays total duration of the generated signal or total number of bytes written to tape images.
* Signal or tape image generators can be executed in a preview mode. In the preview mode, no output is generated, but all checks take place and total duration of the generated signal or total number of bytes written to tape images are determined and displayed in the status bar. This will help you to determine if the signal will fit in a tape side.
* Error messages displayed by the signal or tape image generators are aggregated and displayed in a single window. The error messages also include input file name, so it is easier to identify offending playlist items.
* Batch processing now supports also tape images on input. Use the new TAPE-IMAGE-CONVERTOR keyword.
* Duration of the protective silence generated at the end of all WAVE files can be adjusted.
* Errors are detected earlier. First all playlist items are converted to generator instructions. If there are errors, the processing is terminated. If there are no errors, the electric signal or tape images are generated. 

Turbo 2000 Blockloading and ChainLoading

* The file format and loaders have been modified to use different identification bytes at the beginnings of blocks. This prevents normal Turbo 2000 or Universal Turbo loaders from confusing these blocks with normal Turbo 2000/Super Turbo files.



Changes from version 8.6.5 to 8.6.6
===================================

This new version enhances user experience (UX)

The Tools menu

* Items in the Tools menu have been repositioned and regrouped. The most important functions are closer to the top of the menu.

Program Configuration Facility  

User interface provided by the Program Configuration Facility has been streamlined.
  
* The number of menu items has been reduced from 3 to 1.
* Buttons displayed by the "Preferences" dialog now have clear meanings - "OK", "Cancel", and "Defaults".
* You can click the new "Defaults" button to set default values for configuration entries of the currently selected section.
* Configuration is saved automatically after clicking the "OK" button.

Window Management

* Hierarchy of Windows has been fixed to prevent problems with window management.

Documentation Updates

* Section 1 of the documentation has been restructured. A new subsection describes files processed by Turgen System.
